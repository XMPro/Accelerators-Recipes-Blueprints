{% include feature_row %}

This widget is broken down into two sections, the left (Total Assets) is the total area and the right section past the vertical line is whhere you can get specific.  The right section will grow and shrink depending on the data source that is provided.

To optimize the available space, this widget features a single primary heading without any additional subheadings.

The Up and Down arrows serve as indicators and can be configured in the block properties to either display a fixed, static up-and-down appearance or transform into a different shape.

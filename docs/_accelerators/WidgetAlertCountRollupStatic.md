This widget is broken down into two sections, with the data presented in a static format. The left section, labeled 'Total Assets,' provides an overview of the total assets without any dynamic changes or real-time updates. It serves as a fixed reference point for users to quickly grasp the overall picture.

To optimize the available space, this widget features a single primary heading without any additional subheadings.

The Up and Down arrows serve as indicators and can be configured in the block properties to either display a fixed, static up-and-down appearance or transform into a different shape.

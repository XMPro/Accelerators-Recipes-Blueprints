This widget closely resembles the <a href="WidgetContentwithIndicator">Content with Indicator</a> widget, with the primary distinction lying in its visual styling. As readily noticeable, this widget incorporates a unique design feature â€” an elegant vertical line positioned beneath the primary heading.
{: .notice--info}

This widget includes a main title, a subheading, an indicator, and more detailed content below. It's designed to present information clearly and in an organized way. The main title summarizes the main idea, the subheading adds extra context, the indicator shows status, and the detailed content provides more information. These parts work together to make the widget effective for different types of content.
{: .notice}

This widget's deliberate design choice involves featuring solely a primary heading without a subheading. This decision aligns with the inclusion of a descriptive heading below, serving to emphasize and provide supplementary context.
{: .notice--warning}

To set up and utilize the Data Source section of this widget, begin by selecting the "Data Source" box, then access the "Block Properties" to specify the data source you want to integrate. Remember to interact with the elements within the box and modify their values according to the data source.

Note that when you select a data source containing, for instance, three rows of data, the widget will promptly display these three individual elements. Moreover, it demonstrates adaptability by automatically resizing itself to match the count of the provided data source.

This widget is structured with three distinct columns, each serving a specific purpose: the title column, the indicator column, and the data status column. Additionally, it features a prominent heading, strategically employed to underscore the importance of the content within the widget. Also these elements presents static information, meaning that the content remains unchanged and serves as a reference point and is fixed and cannot be modified once the system is published.
{: .notice}

This widget features a primary heading without a subheading, a deliberate choice made to optimize the available space it occupies.
{: .notice--warning}

![image-right]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/Patterns/Widgets/ListwithIndicatorStatic/DarkTheme/ListwithIndicatorStaticDesignMode.png){: .align-right}
To employ and configure this widget, simply select the element you wish to modify, and then navigate to the "Block Properties" section where you can make the necessary adjustments. It's important to note that any values you enter will remain static and unchangeable while the system is running. Furthermore, you have the freedom to customize the appearance of each indicator to match your design preferences.

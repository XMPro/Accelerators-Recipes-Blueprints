![image-right]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/Patterns/Widgets/ChartWithMetricRight/DarkTheme/ChartWithMetricRightDesignMode.png){: .align-right}
To set up the chart within this widget, you have several configuration options at your disposal. Start by selecting the chart element itself, and then access the "Block Properties" menu to link a data source to the chart. Additionally, you can fine-tune the appearance and behavior of the chart by configuring the X and Y axes. Tailor them to correspond to the specific data types you're working with, and if desired, adjust the color schemes to align with your personal preferences. These are just a few of the numerous configuration choices available to help you create a chart that suits your needs and preferences.

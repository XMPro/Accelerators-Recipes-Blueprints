This widget shares core functionality with both the <a href="WidgetContentwithIndicator">Content with Indicator</a> and <a href="WidgetContentwithIndicatorStyled">Content with Indicator - Styled</a> widgets. However, the key distinction lies in the arrangement of its elements. As you can observe, the indicator is situated at the bottom of the box, in contrast to the other two widgets where it resides at the top, positioned just below the Main Heading.
This variation in element placement offers flexibility in presentation, catering to different design preferences and emphasizing the content within the Main Heading in a unique way.
{: .notice--warning}

This widget includes a main title, a subheading, an indicator, and more detailed content below. It's designed to present information clearly and in an organized way. The main title summarizes the main idea, the subheading adds extra context, the indicator shows status, and the detailed content provides more information. These parts work together to make the widget effective for different types of content.
{: .notice}

This widget's deliberate design choice involves featuring solely a primary heading without a subheading. This decision aligns with the inclusion of a descriptive heading below, serving to emphasize and provide supplementary context.

To set up and utilize the Data Source section of this widget, begin by selecting the "Data Source" box, then access the "Block Properties" to specify the data source you want to integrate. Remember to interact with the elements within the box and modify their values according to the data source.

Note that when you select a data source containing, for instance, three rows of data, the widget will promptly display these three individual elements. Moreover, it demonstrates adaptability by automatically resizing itself to match the count of the provided data source.

This widget is designed with versatility in mind, offering two distinct formats for presenting information. It includes both a two-column title-value pair layout and a single-column title-value pair arrangement. Notably, the rows within this widget feature an alternating color scheme, which can be tailored to your specific preferences and requirements. And to enhance the visual appeal and content emphasis, a prominent heading is also included. 
{: .notice}

This widget features a primary heading without a subheading, a deliberate choice made to optimize the available space it occupies.
{: .notice--warning}

![image-right]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/Patterns/Widgets/StyledCardDisplay/DarkTheme/StyledCardDisplayDesignMode.png){: .align-right}

This widget comprises two primary components: the description and the circular gauge. The "description" provides textual information or context, typically explaining the data or the purpose of the gauge. The circular gauge serves as a visual representation of data or a measurement. It is a circular graphical element that can display information in a dynamic and easily interpretable manner, such as a progress indicator, a speedometer, or any other data visualization that can be represented in a circular format
{: .notice}

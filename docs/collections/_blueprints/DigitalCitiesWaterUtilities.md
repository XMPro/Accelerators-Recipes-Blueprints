description: "<strong>Digital Cities - Water Utilities</strong>"
extract: "A digital twin application employing a leveled approach to monitoring and optimization. A comprehensive overview of the city's water infrastructure, including flood prediction analytics. The focus then shifts to individual pump stations, integrating efficiency monitoring at each site. The app drills down to detailed insights into the performance of each pump, ensuring thorough and efficient management of the city's water systems."

## Application
Three level of a digital city water utilities. Starting with an overview where the live data and status of reservoirs, pump station and treatment plants can be viewed in whole on an interactive map. Flood prediction is actively displayed for the whole area. The next level is the facility level, specifically a pump station for this demonstration, which focuses on aggregate asset performance and energy efficiency. Finally a drilldown of the pump assets for a refined condition monitoring insights and preventative actions. The application is configured using:

### Pump Unity

An example of how to prepare and stream multiple pumps data to the Application Designer for a 3D model. The data stream is configured using: 

| Agent                                                              | Description                                            |

## Steps to Import

### 1. Create/confirm variables
Ensure the following variables are available to be used in the data stream:
- App Designer URL
- App Designer Integration Key <strong>(Encrypted)</strong>


### 2. Import SQL Tables
- Execute SQL files so that the `DemoWorkManagementPump` and `DemoMaintenanceHistory` tables are present and contain data.

### 3. Save the Python Model 
- Download and save the <code>FloodPrediction.py</code> Python file to a chosen directory that is accessible by the [Stream Host](https://documentation.xmpro.com/concepts/collection).
- Note this directory as it needs to be updated in the [1] Flood Prediction Data Stream.


### 4. Import the Data Streams
Follow the guide for applicable parts:
- Select the highest agent version number on import, if prompted
- Assign Access to others as required
- <strong>XMPro agents</strong> ({% include framework/shortcodes/image.html width="14px" height="14px" src="/assets/images/icons/xmpro_app.webp" %}) - ensure the URL & Integration Key are selected
- <strong>Recommendation agent</strong> ({% include framework/shortcodes/image.html width="14px" height="14px" src="/assets/images/icons/run_recommendation.webp" %}) - ensure the URL & Integration Key are selected
- <strong>Read Recommendation</strong> ({% include framework/shortcodes/image.html width="14px" height="14px" src="/assets/images/icons/run_recommendation.webp" %}) - Do not configure yet, this will be configured once the recommendation is imported
- <strong>Calculated Field</strong> ({% include framework/shortcodes/image.html width="14px" height="14px" src="/assets/images/icons/calculated_field.svg" %}) - ensure the correct model file paths are configured (path chosen in __step 2__)
- <strong>Python agent</strong> ({% include framework/shortcodes/image.html width="14px" height="14px" src="/assets/images/icons/python.png" %}) - ensure the correct Python version is selected, a stream host has access to a Python runtime, the paths are set and the script is applied.
- <strong>SQL Context Provider</strong> ({% include framework/shortcodes/image.html width="14px" height="14px" src="/assets/images/icons/SQL.png" %}) - ensure the correct SQL credentials are entered.
- Click Apply and save the data stream
- Publish the data stream and open the live view
- Ensure there is data in the live view by monitoring the agents


### 5. Import the Recommendations

Map the data stream to import

  | Recommendation Name               | Category                      | Data Stream                |
  | --------------------------------- | ----------------------------- | -------------------------- |
  | Condition Monitoring Asset        | Utilities (or own choice)     | Pump                       |
  | Condition Monitoring Overview     | Utilities (or own choice)     | Overview                   |
  | Flood Prediction                  | Utilities (or own choice)     | Flood Prediction           |

Assign Access to others as required
  {% include framework/shortcodes/image.html src="/assets/images/Blueprints/DigitalCities/WaterUtilities/Recommendation_Access.png" %}


### 6. Set Read Recommendation Agents

extract: "In the realm of urban water management, forecasting flood events with high precision is critical for safeguarding infrastructure, managing resources, and protecting communities.

The ability to predict a critical event means anticipating and preparing for flood events with the utmost accuracy. This XMPro Notebook applies a machine learning approach, utilizing Support Vector Regression (SVR), to predict the probability of flood events in an urban setting.

By analyzing historical weather data and utilizing real-time environmental monitoring, we aim to enhance flood prediction models, offering a valuable tool for water utilities and disaster response teams in their efforts to mitigate the impacts of floods in urban areas."

## Notebook
The Notebook `Flood Prediction.ipynb` can re-run to generate the model file for the Python agent.
The datasets used with this model development are in the same folder as the notebook file, you can find them by clicking on the `CSV - Weather Data SIngapore`item in the links list.

This process involves training a model and saving the weights - be sure to place the resulting file in a location that the Stream Host can access.
